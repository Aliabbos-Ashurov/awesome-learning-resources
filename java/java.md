# Java Learning Roadmap

Hi! I’ve created this roadmap for you to learn Java from beginner to advanced. I’ve included a mix of resources like videos, books, and documentation. For videos, watch them step-by-step. If you get stuck or confused, use AI tools like ChatGPT or Grok AI to clarify concepts. I’ve added official documentation to each section to make your knowledge solid—always check these out because official docs are where you can always find the most reliable, up-to-date information. Let’s get started!
